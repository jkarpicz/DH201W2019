Once an institution selects an art piece for purchase or commission, that institution becomes a steward of that piece as part of the State Art Collection.

On average, <a href="http://www.cwu.edu/art-collection/public-art-new-construction-washington-state-arts-commission" target="_blank">there have been around 300 art allocations every two years</a>; however, because the funding is tied to to capital projects, available funding fluctuates when there are larger or smaller investments in state buildings. The <a href="https://www.arts.wa.gov/media/dynamic/docs/FINAL%20Strategic%20Plan%202015-17.pdf" target="_blank">2015-2017 Strategic Plan for the Washington State Arts Commission</a>&nbsp;notes that â€œAs the economy has faltered, the enacted state capital appropriations have declined even as the legislature sought to create more jobs through construction. For example, the 2009-11 capital budgets were roughly 20% higher than 2013-15" (<span style="font-size: 1rem;">TAB A-11). These declines limit the ability to invest in the maintainence and acquisition of new pieces for the collection, particularly in "rural areas and distant communities" that may be experience greater declines in state building investments, but which "deserve equal support" (TAB A-11).</span></p></div>

It is important to keep in mind that the cost for each piece of artwork varies, and so the chart likely reflects both fluctuations in the capital budgets / funding allocated to the program each year as well as differences in the cost and/or size of pieces. A limitation of the dataset is that cost information for each acquisition was not readily available, this would have allowed for a trend line showing the amount spent per year on public art through the Art in Public Places program.</span></p>

However, the chart overall appears to trend downwards, suggesting that institutions are moving towards acquiring site-specific pieces. This shift coincides the way that "public art has moved away from discrete objects placed in public plazas to art that is integrated within a site. In the 1980s and 1990s, there was a move in the public art field to bring artists onto design teams to work with architects to incorporate artwork into the design of a building or plaza, and public art moved toward the goal of creating a sense of place" (North Carolina Arts Council, p. 35). </p><p>There are two additionally considerations in interpreting the chart below. The first, given the fluctuations in funding for state capital projects (described above), it may be that artists have similarly shifted towards submitting samples of work that can be commissioned once there is funding secured by the state. The second, is that institutions can only commission new work <a href="http://www.cwu.edu/art-collection/public-art-new-construction-washington-state-arts-commission">if the acquisition budget is over $25,000</a>, otherwise they will&nbsp;purchase existing work through the Artists Resource Bank. The shift towards commissioned, site-specific work may also indicate that the average construction costs for individual capital projects have grown over time.</p></div>
