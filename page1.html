            <div class="mbr-text col-12 mbr-fonts-style display-7 col-md-8"><p>The early colleges in the United States borrowed from the residential model of prominent English universities in their emphasis on developing an insulated, secluded campus (Thelin, 2011). While most institutions lacked the funds necessary to fully recreate the "planned quandrangle" that characterized Oxbridge and Cambridge (Thelin, 2011, p. 9), the influence of English universities was still prominent visible in campus architetural styles and particularly in the prominence and centrality of green space on campus, “a signature central open space that disrupts the dense city fabric” (Bowman, 2011, p.21). At the early hilltop colleges in New England that seeded the enduring image of <strong>[adjective]</strong> the rural institution, the design of the campus was meant to isolate undergraduate students from the “negative influences of cities” in order to “build character and spiritual values" (Diner, 2017, p. 3). By contrast, the porosity of urban campuses captured their “inward and outward character”: these campuses were marked by costly physical buildings that stood out from any comparable construction of the colonial era (Thelin, 2011), but yet they were also not (yet) physically walled off to the community, inviting interaction between the campus and the community (Bowman, 2011, p.23). In some cases, the relationship to the city was significant to urban institutions' stated mission: e<span style="font-size: 1rem;">arly presidents situating their institutions as benefitting from their proximity to the city context in pursuing learning and research that was relevant to society (Bowman, 2011; Diner, 2017). However, urban institutions were not always committed to reciprocating benefits to the communities in which they operated (Trani and Holsworth, 2010, p.47). On the contrary, in the early 1900s colleges such as Harvard University, Tufts University, Princeton University, and Yale University sought to build buffers between themselves and their communities in the form of buildings, roadways, and actual walls and gates (Bowman, 2011, p.25-26). In this way, since the creation of American colleges and universities, campus has served as a symbol of the institution's teaching mission and/or philosophy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The concept of an institution having a mission of service to its community took hold with the Morrill Land Grant Act of 1862, a quarter of a century before Clark’s founding. The land-grant act was a federal commitment to states to encourage the development of agriculture, competitive economy and served to expand access to higher education for certain populations (Thelin, 2011). White (1991) argues that the legacy of the land grant was the legacy of service as a defining mission of U.S. higher education (p.46).</span></p><p><strong>Campus as a symbol</strong></p><p><span style="font-size: 1rem;">The campus as a symbol: Histories of campus green space (Bowman, 2011), architecture and design of campus as part of “contemporary ethos of higher education…[including] excellence in the arts and literature (Bowen, 1977, pp. 267-269) but also a part of branding and reputation (Kiefer, 2006).</span><br></p><p><strong><br></strong><br></p><p></p></div>
