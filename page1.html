Specifically, it<span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;considers public art as contributing to the </span><em>place-making</em><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> efforts of colleges and universities as sites of learning and community. Paulsen (2010) describes place-making as "</span><strong>generally refer[ing] to the processes by which a space is made useful and meaningful. </strong><span style="font-size: 1rem;"> This may include manipulations of the physical landscape, including land development and building construction, or the attachment of meanings or sentiments to places through shared understandings ... The degree to which these meanings persist over time reflects another element of placemaking, the struggle to associate particular memories or identities with a place" (Paulsen, 2010, p. 600-601). In advocating for place-making at community colleges, Knight (2016) speaks to its ability to "strengthen the connection between people and the places they stay" (p. 8). Public art can therefore be understood as one strategy through which higher education institutions build enduring identities and connections among their students, staff, faculty, alumni, as well as the public.</span></p></div>

This intentionality can be traced to t<span style="font-size: 1rem;">he colonial colleges of the United States, which sought to emulate the character of prominent English universities through architecture and design. The influence of this residential model is visible in the insular, secluded design of campuses as well as the prominence of certain architectural styles, such as "Red brick Georgian buildings with slate roofs, white trim and mullioned windows, clustered around a green,” (Thelin, 2011, p. 1) as well as Collegiate Gothic, a medieval-inspired style, which emerged in the mid-1800s. The Suzzallo Library at the University of Washington, pictured below, is one or many examples of the Collegiate Gothic style.</span></p><p></p></div>

As the U.S. higher education system expanded in late-1800s, many institutions "were busy trying to prove to themselves and to the world at large that they were universities" (Patton, 1967, p. 1). This struggle around establishing credibility, reputation, and prestige would continue into the early-mid 20th Century, with many institutions following Collegiate Gothic or Colonial Revivalism models in order to evoke qualities of heritage, historical significance, and academic prestige&nbsp;(Patton, 1967; Thelin, 2011).</p>

This design emphasis is nt unique; dedicated&nbsp;green space is a prominent, central feature of many American college campuses, dating back to the colonial era, as discussed above. At the University of Oklahoma, Gumprecht (2007) describes there being "a deep heritage in Norman and other college towns to the belief that a college campus
should be green and wooded. It says much about the value placed on campus green spaces that
trees were planted on the University of Oklahoma grounds even before the university hired a single
faculty member or began constructing its first building"&nbsp;(p. 74). <br><br>At the early hilltop colleges in New England, expansive green spaces contriuted to the seclusion of campus, meant to isolate undergraduate students from the “negative influences of cities” in order to “build character and spiritual values" (Diner, 2017, p. 3). At urban institutions, the campus green functioned as “a signature central open space that disrupts the dense city fabric” (Bowman, 2011, p. 21). While the porosity of urban campuses captured a degree of “inward and outward character" inviting interaction between the campus and the community (Bowman, 2011, p.23).<br></p>

This symbolism is equally tied to what Bowen (1977) describes as the "contemporary ethos of higher education…[including] excellence in the arts and literature" (p. 267-269) as it is to "the university's branding strategy" (Kiefer, 2006, p. 17).&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">Public art on campus contributes to "the look and feel of a campus" (Walljasper, 2008, para. 5) in both aspects: aesthetically enhancing the physical environment while simultaneously service as a creative, historical, and artistic resource for students, faculty, and staff. These dual purposes are highlighted in a recent Texas Tribune article on the percent for art program at Texas Tech, the University of Houston and Texas State University; where a contributing artist recognized the program for "ensur[ing]</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;that we don’t have a postwar East German-type sterile, unappealing construction that people don’t want to be around,” and a campus arts administrator described the program as "</span><span style="font-size: 1rem;">providing a primary resource to our faculty and students about these major artistic trends in recent art history" (Hamilton, 2013). Public art is one way that institution's create unique meaning for their campus. Investments in campus art extend a history of strategic attention to campus design and landscape for the overlapping purposes of 1) cultivating an institution's reputation and legitimacy, 2) drawing in competitive pools of students and faculty, and 3) encouraging students "to develop a wider curiosity ... to continue to put ideas and experiences together in new ways" (Clark-Langager, 2002, p. 9).&nbsp;</span></p></div>

As an example, the Washington State Art Collection privileges local artists in their selection process (cite) and many of the artists who have created pieces for Washington's public colleges and universities have attended and/or graduated from a public postsecondary institution in the state. The visualization below shows the number of artists who have attended colleges and universities in the state of Washington. Of the 455 artists who are represented in the dataset, roughly 35% (159) have attended a higher education institution (public or private) in Washington (50% had not attended a Washington college or university; 15% did not have their educational background clearly listed. Of these 159 artists, 96 (~60%) attended the University of Washington as a student. As the flagship state institution and largest in the state system, the University of Washington's significant alumni presence in the collection may represent another way institutions considering reputation, identity, and brand in the curation of campus artwork.<br></p>
